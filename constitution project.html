    <br> be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it,
    <br> with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their
    <br> journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill,
    <br> it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if
    <br> approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined
    <br> by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively.
    <br> If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him,
    <br> the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return,
    <br> in which case it shall not be a law.
    <br><br>
    Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary
    <br>(except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect,
